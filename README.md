Aperiodic Monotile in SVG
=========================

This repo contains a small python script for generating the aperiodic monotile
described by [Smith et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10798).  The script can
also generate a 1-patch around the monotile, following the tiling shown in
Figure 1.1 of the preprint.

```
> pip install svgdraw
> python3 monotile.py
```
